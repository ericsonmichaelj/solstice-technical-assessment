## Solstice Technical Assesment

The code is divided into three parts: `server`, `client`, and `shared-types`. In order to run the code the server should run first. The front-end is written in React and Typescript, the backend is written in Express and Typescript. 

`yarn install`
`npm run start`

Next run the client as:

`yarn install`
`npm run start`

`Shared-types` is a module shared between the client and server.

Both the `client` and `server` folder have tests and be run using `npm run test`. The server uses `mocha` and `supertest` while the frontend uses `jest` and `testing-library`
